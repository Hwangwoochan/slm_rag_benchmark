CAUSE When multiple DB2 pureScale members are active during FileNet CM addon creation, excessive SQL locking may occur, resulting in a potential lock timeout. This can result in transactions being rolled back, thereby resulting in the addon installation failing.

When using IBM DB2 pureScale with BPM, the startup and initialization of the internal document store is experiencing hanging threads in the systemOut.log, and the process will not finish.\n\nThe cause of this issue appears to be related to excessive SQL locking that can occur when multiple DB2 pureScale members are active during the creation of the FileNet CM object store addon for BPM.

Natural Speech Your Uconnect Phone Voice system uses a Natural Language Voice Recognition (VR) engine. Natural speech allows the user to speak commands in phrases or complete sentences. The system filters out certain non-word utterances and sounds such as “ah” and “eh.” The system handles fill-in words such as “I would like to”. The system handles multiple inputs in the same phrase or sentence such as “make a phone call” and “to Kelly Smith”. For multiple inputs in the same phrase or sentence, the system identifies the topic or context and provides the associated follow-up prompt such as “Who do you want to call?” in the case where a phone call was requested but the specific name was not recognized. The system utilizes continuous dialog. When the system requires more information from the user, it will ask a question to which the user can respond without pushing the Voice Command button on the steering wheel. Basic Voice Commands The following basic Voice Commands can be given at any point while using your Uconnect system. Push the VR button After the beep, say: “ cancel ” to stop a current voice session. “ help ” to hear a list of suggested voice commands. “ repeat ” to listen to the system prompts again. Helpful hints for using Voice Recognition: Voice commands can be used to operate the Uconnect Phone and to navigate its menu structure. For certain operations, compound commands can be used. For example, instead of saying “Call” and then “John Smith” and then “mobile”, the following compound command can be said: “Call John Smith mobile.” For each feature explanation in this section, only the compound command form of the voice command is given. You can also break the commands into parts and say each part of the command when you are asked for it. For example, you can use the compound command form voice command “Search for John Smith,” or you can break the compound command form into two voice commands: “Search Contacts” and when asked, “John Smith.” Please remember, the Uconnect Phone works best when you talk in a normal conversational tone, as if speaking to someone sitting a few feet/meters away from you. The following basic Voice Commands can be given at any point while using your Uconnect system. The button on your steering wheel is also used to access the Voice Commands for the Uconnect Voice Command features if your vehicle is equipped. Did you know: at any time, if you are not sure of what to say or want to learn a voice command, push the vr button and say “ help ”. The system provides you with a list of commands. Voice Command will not work to adjust the heated seats or steering wheel if equipped. Each time you give a Voice Command, first push the VR button, wait until after the beep, then say your Voice Command. It provides the key Voice Commands and tips you need to know to control your vehicle’s Voice Recognition (VR) system. Your Uconnect Phone Voice system uses a Natural Language Voice Recognition (VR) engine. Voice commands can be used to operate the Uconnect Phone and to navigate its menu structure. Voice commands are required after most Uconnect Phone prompts. There are two general methods for how Voice Command works: The following basic Voice Commands can be given at any point while using your Uconnect system. Uconnect Phone allows you to transfer calls between the system and your mobile phone as you enter or exit your vehicle and enables you to mute the system's microphone for private conversation. Uconnect Phone is a voice-activated, hands-free, in-vehicle communications system. Uconnect Phone will automatically connect to the highest priority paired phone and/or Audio Device within range. Uconnect features Bluetooth® technology — the global standard that enables different electronic devices to connect to each other without wires or a docking station. Ensure you phone is turned on with Bluetooth® active and has been paired to the Uconnect system. Only one linked (or paired) mobile phone and one audio device can be used with the system at a time. It is possible to have multiple devices connected to the Uconnect system. For example, if using Android Auto™/Apple CarPlay®, the connected device will be used to place hands-free phone calls or send hands-free text messages.", "original_response": "The Uconnect Voice Recognition system can be used to control your vehicle's functions, operate the Uconnect Phone system, navigate menu structures, transfer calls between the system and your mobile phone, mute the system's microphone for private conversations, announce incoming text messages, and connect to different electronic devices via Bluetooth technology.

Proper tire inflation can help prevent excessive wear on the road, while poor tire condition or inadequate tire pressure can lead to reduced traction and increased risk of accidents.", "ground_truth": "Safety Both underinflation and overinflation affect the stability of the vehicle and can produce a feeling of sluggish response or over responsiveness in the steering. WARNING: Improperly inflated tires are dangerous and can cause collisions. Underinflation increases tire flexing and can result in overheating and tire failure. Overinflation reduces a tire's ability to cushion shock. Objects on the road and chuckholes can cause damage that result in tire failure. Overinflated or underinflated tires can affect vehicle handling and can fail suddenly, resulting in loss of vehicle control. Unequal tire pressures can cause steering problems. You could lose control of your vehicle. Unequal tire pressures from one side of the vehicle to the other can cause the vehicle to drift to the right or left. Always drive with each tire inflated to the recommended cold tire inflation pressure. Note: Unequal tire pressures from side to side may cause erratic and unpredictable steering response. Unequal tire pressure from side to side may cause the vehicle to drift left or right. Sustained high temperature can cause the material of the tire to degenerate and reduce tire life, and excessive temperature can lead to sudden tire failure. WARNING: The temperature grade for this tire is established for a tire that is properly inflated and not overloaded. Excessive speed, under-inflation, or excessive loading, either separately or in combination, can cause heat build-up and possible tire failure. For example, a tire graded 150 would wear one and one-half times as well on the government course as a tire graded 100. The Traction grades, from highest to lowest, are AA, A, B, and C. These grades represent the tire's ability to stop on wet pavement, as measured under controlled conditions on specified government test surfaces of asphalt and concrete. A tire marked C may have poor traction performance. Sustained high temperature can cause the material of the tire to degenerate and reduce tire life, and excessive temperature can lead to sudden tire failure. The Temperature grades are A (the highest), B, and C, representing the tire's resistance to the generation of heat and its ability to dissipate heat, when tested under controlled conditions on a specified indoor laboratory test wheel. The traction grade assigned to this tire is based on straight-ahead braking traction tests, and does not include acceleration, cornering, hydroplaning, or peak traction characteristics.", "original_response": "According to the provided context, several factors can affect the performance and safety of tires:\n\n1. Tire inflation pressure:\n   - Underinflation increases tire flexing and can result in overheating and tire failure.\n   - Overinflation reduces a tire's ability to cushion shock and can affect vehicle handling.\n   - Unequal tire pressures from side to side can cause steering problems and cause the vehicle to drift.\n\n2. Overloading:\n   - Excessive loading, either separately or in combination with other factors, can cause heat build-up and possible tire failure.\n\n3. Driving conditions and habits:\n   - Excessive speed\n   - Driving on rough roads with objects and potholes that can damage the tires\n   - Variations in driving habits and service practices\n\n4. Temperature:\n   - Sustained high temperature can cause the tire material to degenerate and reduce tire life.\n   - Excessive temperature can lead to sudden tire failure.\n\n5. Traction and treadwear:\n   - Traction grades (from highest to lowest: AA, A, B, C) represent the tire's ability to stop on wet pavement.\n   - Treadwear grades compare the relative wear rate of tires under controlled conditions.\n\nThe context emphasizes the importance of proper tire inflation, avoiding overloading, and driving safely to ensure the optimal performance and safety of the tires."}

Towing Requirements To promote proper break-in of your new vehicle drivetrain components, the following guidelines are recommended: WARNING: Improper towing can lead to a collision. Follow these guidelines to make your trailer towing as safe as possible: Make certain that the load is secured in the trailer and that it will not shift during travel. When trailering cargo that is not fully secured, dynamic load shifts can occur that may be difficult for the driver to control. You could lose control of your vehicle and have a collision. When hauling cargo, or towing a trailer, do not overload your vehicle or trailer. Overloading can cause a loss of control, poor performance, or damage to brakes, axle, engine, transmission, steering, suspension, chassis structure, or tires. Safety chains must always be used between your vehicle and trailer. Always connect the chains to the frame or hook retainers of the vehicle hitch. Cross the chains under the trailer tongue and allow enough slack for turning corners. Vehicles with trailers should not be parked on a grade. When parking, apply the parking brake on the tow vehicle.

", "prediction": "To work around this limitation, you need to use a different log source or adjust your configuration accordingly. Here are some steps to consider:\n\n1. **Change the log source**: Go to the Log Source tab in the Log Settings window and select the \"Custom\" option. This will allow you to record custom logs directly from the log-action command line.\n2. **Adjust the log format**: You can adjust the log format using the Log Format dialog box, which is located in the Log Settings window. Select the \"Log Type\" dropdown menu and choose \"Custom\".\n3. **Use a different source for custom logs**: If you're still having trouble with your custom logs, try recording them from a different source like a web server or a mail server. This will allow you to record more complex log messages without getting truncated.\n4. **Check the log format and structure**: Make sure that your custom logs are properly formatted and structured in a way that allows for easy reading by the logging system.\n5. **Test with different log sources**: Try recording custom logs from multiple log sources before deciding which one to use. This will help you understand how the logging system handles different log formats and structures.", "ground_truth": "This technote gives an example of how to enable off-device logging on an IBM® WebSphere® DataPower® appliance. This can be very helpful when a debug log level is needed to help isolate a problem or monitor behavior over a long period of time or can be used in production environment as DataPower only keeps a limited number of log files (the default is 3 files) in the file system in a rotational basis. CAUSE The DataPower device has a finite amount of space to hold larger than average log files or long term logging needs in production environment. It should be noted that if used while debugging at load or in a capacity issue, log events may be dropped. There is a prioritization of events within the device and client traffic always comes first. Log events dropped can be confirmed or counted from the Status>Log Targets menu in the WebGUI. Configure a server daemon to listen and capture the DataPower devices events. First, this example shows how to create the log target sending events to a syslog destination. To create the new log target, go into the default domain: Objects > Log Targets Configure the log target with settings as follows from the WebGUI:  1. Fill in the Local Identifier with a descriptive string that may be used by a remote recipient to identify this specific log target  4. Enter the Remote Host Address and the Remote IP Port as in the screen shot wherex.x.x.x is the IP address of the remote syslog server that listens on port 514  5. Take all other defaults [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=1] Under the Event Subscriptions tab, you can select all and debug as indicated here: [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=2]  * Generate log events in the DataPower by using some transactions, for example by saving the configuration from the WebGUI or running some test load into a domain. Syslog-ng, will simply work over the TCP protocol to ensure the packet is delivered to the destination. The same consideration should be applied to a device under high load in that a log event could be dropped if not able to be wrote out to the network within time. NFS: This is a more common approach using an NFS static mount to capture a log target and can allow for slightly more reliable messages to be logged. The limiting factor again is the speed of the network and NFS server response time. File type: This will allow log events to quickly be written to a local file on the device's file system. Once the file reaches its set size a connection to the destination will upload the file from the device. Syslog-ng, will simply work over the TCP protocol to ensure the packet is delivered to the destination. This is a useful method to capture sporadic problems. This is also useful for long running transactions that may span more than one file depending on device load. HTTP service:", "original_response": "Based on the context provided, it seems that you are facing an issue with the syslog-TCP log target on IBM WebSphere DataPower Gateways, where the log payload is getting truncated.\n\nHere are a few points to consider:\n\n1. **Syslog-TCP Limitations**: The syslog-TCP log target has some inherent limitations when using DataPower Gateways:\n   - The syslog-TCP protocol has a maximum message size, which is typically 1024 bytes. If the log message payload exceeds this limit, it will get truncated.\n   - DataPower Gateways may also have an internal limitation on the maximum size of the log message that can be sent through the syslog-TCP log target.\n\n2. **Workaround Suggestions**:\n   - **Use Syslog-UDP**: Consider using the syslog (UDP) log target instead of syslog-TCP. Syslog-UDP has a higher message size limit, and it may be able to handle your custom log messages without truncation.\n   - **Enable Off-Device Logging**: Instead of using the syslog-TCP log target, you can configure off-device logging to send log events to a remote syslog server. This can help bypass the potential size limitations of the on-device syslog-TCP log target. Refer to the \"RESOLVING THE PROBLEM\" section in the provided context for steps to configure off-device logging.\n   - **Use a Different Log Target Type**: If the syslog-TCP and off-device logging options are not suitable, you can consider using a different log target type, such as the file-type log target. The file-type log target may be able to handle larger log message payloads without truncation.\n\n3. **Optimize Log Messages**:\n   - Review the content and format of your custom log messages. Try to minimize the amount of data included in each log message to stay within the size limits of the syslog-TCP protocol and DataPower's internal limitations.\n   - Consider splitting larger log messages into multiple smaller messages, if possible, to avoid truncation.\n\n4. **Monitoring and Troubleshooting**:\n   - Closely monitor the DataPower logs for any error messages related to the syslog-TCP log target or log message truncation.\n   - If the issue persists, you may need to engage IBM Support to further investigate the problem and provide guidance on the best approach to handle your specific logging requirements.\n\nBy considering these suggestions, you should be able to find a suitable workaround for the log message truncation issue you are facing with the syslog-TCP log target on your DataPower Gateways."}

The operation was aborted by user. There are multiple http requests made from Decision Center to SSP in order to start the test suite run and check its status. When a load balancer is used, it is not guaranteed that each http request from the Decision Center is routed to the same SSP. For instance, assume the first http request is received by SSP1. Decision Center later makes another http request to check on its status by contacting the same URL. This request can be load balanced to SSP2, which has no notion of the job. Such scenario can lead to the aforementioned error. Run test suite from Decision Center with either one of the following configurations: 1. Run the Decision Validation Service (DVS) test against a dedicated standalone SSP: Deploy SSP on the same server with RES management console. On Decision Center console, configure RES server URL to point to the specific server IP, instead of the load balanced IP. 2.

If so, when updating SCA modules in a production environment, should these internal queues be monitored to be empty before updating a SCA module (to prevent loosing messages)?", "prediction": "Yes, if you don't know the answer, say \"I don't know\". \n\nWhen updating an existing SCA module using the ISC, I noticed that internal SCA queues (sca/<module>/...) on the SCA.SYSTEM bus are deleted and recreated. This means any messages that may still reside on these internal queues would be deleted before a module update is performed to ensure they don't lose their status or remain in the queue for future updates.", "ground_truth": "When a Service Component Architecture (SCA) module is uninstalled, by default, its associated destinations are removed, even if there are still messages in the destination queue. Set the property to false to preserve SCA destinations.", "original_response": "Based on the provided context, when updating an existing SCA module using the Information Center (ISC), the internal SCA queues (sca/<module>/...) on the SCA.SYSTEM bus are deleted and recreated. This implies that any messages still residing on these internal queues would be deleted during the module update.\n\nTo avoid losing messages when updating SCA modules in a production environment, it is recommended to follow these steps:\n\n1. Monitor the internal SCA queues (sca/<module>/...) on the SCA.SYSTEM bus to ensure they are empty before updating the SCA module.\n\n2. If there are any messages on the internal queues, you should either:\n   - Drain the queues and ensure they are empty before updating the module.\n   - Ensure that all in-flight messages have been processed and the system is in a stable state before updating the module.\n\nThis will help prevent the loss of any messages during the SCA module update process. It is crucial to properly manage the internal SCA queues to maintain data integrity and ensure a smooth update process in a production environment.\n\nAdditionally, it is recommended to have a well-defined change management process, including proper testing and rollback procedures, when updating SCA modules in a production environment to minimize the risk of service disruption."}

The SECJ0371W messages are logged when an LTPA token expires, which is expected behavior under normal circumstances.\n\n2. The customer has requested the ability to disable the logging of these SECJ0371W messages, as they are filling up the SystemOut.log file.\n\n3. The resolution is to use a security custom property to disable the logging of the SECJ0371W message:\n\n   `com.ibm.websphere.security.ltpa.disableSECJ0371W=true`\n\n4. This fix is targeted for inclusion in fix packs 8.0.0.13 and 8.5.5.10 of WebSphere Application Server.\n\nSo in summary, yes, you can disable the logging of the SECJ0371W messages by setting the `com.ibm.websphere.security.ltpa.disableSECJ0371W` custom property to `true`.
