Natural Speech Your Uconnect Phone Voice system uses a Natural Language Voice Recognition (VR) engine. Natural speech allows the user to speak commands in phrases or complete sentences. The system filters out certain non-word utterances and sounds such as “ah” and “eh.” The system handles fill-in words such as “I would like to”. The system handles multiple inputs in the same phrase or sentence such as “make a phone call” and “to Kelly Smith”. For multiple inputs in the same phrase or sentence, the system identifies the topic or context and provides the associated follow-up prompt such as “Who do you want to call?” in the case where a phone call was requested but the specific name was not recognized. The system utilizes continuous dialog. When the system requires more information from the user, it will ask a question to which the user can respond without pushing the Voice Command button on the steering wheel. Basic Voice Commands The following basic Voice Commands can be given at any point while using your Uconnect system. Push the VR button After the beep, say: “ cancel ” to stop a current voice session. “ help ” to hear a list of suggested voice commands. “ repeat ” to listen to the system prompts again. Helpful hints for using Voice Recognition: Voice commands can be used to operate the Uconnect Phone and to navigate its menu structure. For certain operations, compound commands can be used. For example, instead of saying “Call” and then “John Smith” and then “mobile”, the following compound command can be said: “Call John Smith mobile.” For each feature explanation in this section, only the compound command form of the voice command is given. You can also break the commands into parts and say each part of the command when you are asked for it. For example, you can use the compound command form voice command “Search for John Smith,” or you can break the compound command form into two voice commands: “Search Contacts” and when asked, “John Smith.” Please remember, the Uconnect Phone works best when you talk in a normal conversational tone, as if speaking to someone sitting a few feet/meters away from you. The following basic Voice Commands can be given at any point while using your Uconnect system. The button on your steering wheel is also used to access the Voice Commands for the Uconnect Voice Command features if your vehicle is equipped.

Editor for Messages supports only Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) web browser versions - IE 6, IE 7, IE 8, IE 9 (compatibility view), IE 10 (Compatibility view), and IE 11 (Compatibility view).\n\n2. There are known issues with the functionality of Editor for Messages when using IE 9 or above versions. The workaround is to use IE compatibility view.\n\n3. The steps provided explain how to enable IE compatibility view when accessing the Editor for Messages web server.\n\nSo, the likely reason the logon page is not working correctly is that the users are trying to access it from a new terminal server environment that is using a different web browser, such as Firefox or Chrome, instead of Internet Explorer. \n\nTo resolve this issue, the users will need to access the Editor for Messages web UI using Internet Explorer and ensure that the compatibility view is enabled for the web server IP address. Following the steps provided in the context should allow the users to log in successfully."}

WARNING: Improperly inflated tires are dangerous and can cause collisions. Underinflation increases tire flexing and can result in overheating and tire failure. Overinflation reduces a tire's ability to cushion shock. Objects on the road and chuckholes can cause damage that result in tire failure. Overinflated or underinflated tires can affect vehicle handling and can fail suddenly, resulting in loss of vehicle control. Unequal tire pressures can cause steering problems. You could lose control of your vehicle. Unequal tire pressures from one side of the vehicle to the other can cause the vehicle to drift to the right or left. Always drive with each tire inflated to the recommended cold tire inflation pressure. Note: Unequal tire pressures from side to side may cause erratic and unpredictable steering response. Unequal tire pressure from side to side may cause the vehicle to drift left or right. Sustained high temperature can cause the material of the tire to degenerate and reduce tire life, and excessive temperature can lead to sudden tire failure. WARNING: The temperature grade for this tire is established for a tire that is properly inflated and not overloaded. Excessive speed, under-inflation, or excessive loading, either separately or in combination, can cause heat build-up and possible tire failure. For example, a tire graded 150 would wear one and one-half times as well on the government course as a tire graded 100. The Traction grades, from highest to lowest, are AA, A, B, and C. These grades represent the tire's ability to stop on wet pavement, as measured under controlled conditions on specified government test surfaces of asphalt and concrete. A tire marked C may have poor traction performance. Sustained high temperature can cause the material of the tire to degenerate and reduce tire life, and excessive temperature can lead to sudden tire failure. The Temperature grades are A (the highest), B, and C, representing the tire's resistance to the generation of heat and its ability to dissipate heat, when tested under controlled conditions on a specified indoor laboratory test wheel. The traction grade assigned to this tire is based on straight-ahead braking traction tests, and does not include acceleration, cornering, hydroplaning, or peak traction characteristics.", "original_response": "According to the provided context, several factors can affect the performance and safety of tires:\n\n1.

Before towing a trailer, carefully review this information to tow your load as efficiently and safely as possible. To maintain the New Vehicle Limited Warranty coverage, follow the requirements and recommendations in this manual concerning vehicles used for trailer towing. TOWING A DISABLED VEHICLE This section describes procedures for towing a disabled vehicle using a commercial towing service. If the transmission and drivetrain are operable, disabled vehicles may also be towed as described on Proper towing or lifting equipment is required to prevent damage to your vehicle. Use only tow bars and other equipment designed for this purpose, following equipment manufacturer’s instructions. Use of safety chains is mandatory. Attach a tow bar or other towing device to main structural members of the vehicle, not to fascia/bumpers or associated brackets. State and local laws regarding vehicles under tow must be observed.

Towing Requirements To promote proper break-in of your new vehicle drivetrain components, the following guidelines are recommended: WARNING: Improper towing can lead to a collision. Follow these guidelines to make your trailer towing as safe as possible: Make certain that the load is secured in the trailer and that it will not shift during travel. When trailering cargo that is not fully secured, dynamic load shifts can occur that may be difficult for the driver to control. You could lose control of your vehicle and have a collision. When hauling cargo, or towing a trailer, do not overload your vehicle or trailer. Overloading can cause a loss of control, poor performance, or damage to brakes, axle, engine, transmission, steering, suspension, chassis structure, or tires. Safety chains must always be used between your vehicle and trailer. Always connect the chains to the frame or hook retainers of the vehicle hitch. Cross the chains under the trailer tongue and allow enough slack for turning corners. Vehicles with trailers should not be parked on a grade. When parking, apply the parking brake on the tow vehicle. Put the tow vehicle transmission in PARK. Always block or \"chock\" the trailer wheels. GCWR must not be exceeded. Total weight must be distributed between the tow vehicle and the trailer such that the following four ratings are not exceeded: gvwr gtw gawr tongue weight rating for the trailer hitch utilized caution: do not tow a trailer at all during the first 500 miles (805 km) the new vehicle is driven. The engine, axle or other parts could be damaged. Then, during the first 500 miles (805 km) that a trailer is towed, do not drive over 50 mph (80 km/h) and do not make starts at full throttle.

Syslog-ng, will simply work over the TCP protocol to ensure the packet is delivered to the destination. The same consideration should be applied to a device under high load in that a log event could be dropped if not able to be wrote out to the network within time. NFS: This is a more common approach using an NFS static mount to capture a log target and can allow for slightly more reliable messages to be logged. The limiting factor again is the speed of the network and NFS server response time. File type: This will allow log events to quickly be written to a local file on the device's file system. Once the file reaches its set size a connection to the destination will upload the file from the device. Syslog-ng, will simply work over the TCP protocol to ensure the packet is delivered to the destination. This is a useful method to capture sporadic problems. This is also useful for long running transactions that may span more than one file depending on device load. HTTP service:", "original_response": "Based on the context provided, it seems that you are facing an issue with the syslog-TCP log target on IBM WebSphere DataPower Gateways, where the log payload is getting truncated.\n\nHere are a few points to consider:\n\n1. **Syslog-TCP Limitations**: The syslog-TCP log target has some inherent limitations when using DataPower Gateways:\n   - The syslog-TCP protocol has a maximum message size, which is typically 1024 bytes. If the log message payload exceeds this limit, it will get truncated.\n   - DataPower Gateways may also have an internal limitation on the maximum size of the log message that can be sent through the syslog-TCP log target.\n\n2. **Workaround Suggestions**:\n   - **Use Syslog-UDP**: Consider using the syslog (UDP) log target instead of syslog-TCP. Syslog-UDP has a higher message size limit, and it may be able to handle your custom log messages without truncation.\n   - **Enable Off-Device Logging**: Instead of using the syslog-TCP log target, you can configure off-device logging to send log events to a remote syslog server. This can help bypass the potential size limitations of the on-device syslog-TCP log target. Refer to the \"RESOLVING THE PROBLEM\" section in the provided context for steps to configure off-device logging.\n   - **Use a Different Log Target Type**: If the syslog-TCP and off-device logging options are not suitable, you can consider using a different log target type, such as the file-type log target. The file-type log target may be able to handle larger log message payloads without truncation.\n\n3. **Optimize Log Messages**:\n   - Review the content and format of your custom log messages. Try to minimize the amount of data included in each log message to stay within the size limits of the syslog-TCP protocol and DataPower's internal limitations.\n   - Consider splitting larger log messages into multiple smaller messages, if possible, to avoid truncation.\n\n4. **Monitoring and Troubleshooting**:\n   - Closely monitor the DataPower logs for any error messages related to the syslog-TCP log target or log message truncation.\n   - If the issue persists, you may need to engage IBM Support to further investigate the problem and provide guidance on the best approach to handle your specific logging requirements.\n\nBy considering these suggestions, you should be able to find a suitable workaround for the log message truncation issue you are facing with the syslog-TCP log target on your DataPower Gateways."}

The operation was aborted by user. There are multiple http requests made from Decision Center to SSP in order to start the test suite run and check its status.
